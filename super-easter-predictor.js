Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.
Divide y by 100 and get a quotient b and remainder c.
Divide b by 4 and get quotient d and remainder e.
Divide b + 8 by 25 and get quotient f. Ignore the remainder.
Divide b - f + 1 by 3 and get quotient g. Ignore the remainder.
Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 and get remainder h. Ignore the quotient.
Divide c by 4 and get quotient i and remainder k.
Divide 32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k by 7 and get remainder r. Ignore the quotient.
Divide a + 11 * h + 22 * r by 451 and get quotient m. Ignore the remainder.
Divide h + r - 7 * m + 114 by 31 and get quotient n and remainder p.
The value of n gives the month (3 for March and 4 for April) and the value of p + 1 gives the day of the month. For example, if y is 2003:
